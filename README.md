Omni-Vision App

This is a HUD app that should feel like an AR app that would be deployed on smart glasses. The basic idea is that when a user needs information from their device that is relevant to the surrounding real world environment they must continuously switch from looking up at the world and down at their device â€” and in the time it takes to do this either the the real world context can change, or the digital information is not available without looking away from the real world. Essentially users sometimes need to see real world and their digital information at the same time, but currently they cannot do this - the Omni-Vision app provides a solution to this problem.

User  Tip:

When you open the keyboard for typing the softkeys (Home button, etc. and Status Bar) will not auto-hide. To fix this simply slide from the top to open the Satus Tray and then press on the screen again to close the tray.

NOTE:
The app is currently designed for Nexus 7 and similar sized devices. Smaller phones may have trouble displaying properly. This will be fixed in later versions. Sometimes the right menu will overlap the right display. To correct this simply open the left menu by pressing the WEB button and opening CUSTOM.

Known Bugs:

1) After entering text in a field the soft keyboard will close but the status bar and soft buttons will remain visible. In order to regain "full screen" simply swipe down from the top of the screen to open the notification tray, then touch either the Omni-Vision notification or on the screen to go back to the app.
